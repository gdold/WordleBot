For more detailed usage, see [Usage.ipynb](Usage.ipynb).

The bot can employ any of three strategies, a comparison of which can be seen in [StrategyBenchmarks.ipynb](StrategyBenchmarks.ipynb):
- "entropy" which guesses the word that most reduces the entropy in a list of possible words at each stage
- "scored" which chooses the highest-scored word from a pre-sorted list of words, ranked according to the occurrence of unique common letters
- "random" which picks a random possible word  
For "entropy" and "scored" solvers, if all else is equal, the bot chooses the word that is more frequently used.

The bot uses a dictionary of word frequencies, scraped from Google Ngrams, as well as a list of words scored by the occurrence of unique common letters. See [scrape_word_popularities.py](utils/scrape_word_popularities.py) and [CreateScoredDictionary.ipynb](utils/CreateScoredDictionary.ipynb) for details.
